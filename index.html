      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I have been in the transplant industry since 2011. My career started at Indiana Donor Network (IDN) in 2011 as an Organ Procurement Coordinator. During my time at IDN, I managed all aspects of the organ procurement process. I also served on serval committees and worked closely with the clinical manager to develop antibiotic and lung therapy protocols. In 2013 I accepted a position with Buckeye Transplant Services (BTS) as an import coordinator where I closely work with transplant centers to evaluate organs and help facilitate the organ transplant process. As the company has grown, I have grown with it. I was promoted in 2015 to a Lead Coordinator, from there I was promoted to Clinical Support Manager. Buckeye Transplant is a unique company in healthcare and has given me a unique opportunity to learn many aspects of growing a company. After my time as a Clinical Support Manager, I transitioned into a HR Compliance Manager role where I helped Buckeye with the employee onboarding process and helped ensure compliance with all labor laws across all 50 states. While wearing many hats at Buckeye Transplant I became interested in how technology could help streamline and standardize our many processes. To help Buckeye Transplant grow, I transitioned into an IT Project Manager role to develop tools and applications to streamline and standardized our processes company wide. I am a highly motivated employee skilled in Customer Service, Interpersonal Skills, Management, Process Management, and Healthcare. </p>
